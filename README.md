# AI Advisor Prep Agent

Advisor Prep Agent is a local-first, AI-native web application designed to solve a legacy workflow in wealth management: analyzing messy, unstructured client documents and turning them into an actionable, verifiable prep brief for financial advisors.

## Wealthsimple Application Summary

When I first began this project, I set out to build a personal AI financial coach. However, after researching the wealth management industry, I realized that when it comes to life savings, people trust people. The real bottleneck is the legacy workflow burdening human advisors. Before a client meeting, advisors spend hours manually looking through unstructured data. They have to read old CRM emails, parse dense tax documents, and cross-reference them with current portfolio spreadsheets to find actionable talking points.

To solve this, I built the AI Advisor Prep Agent. It is a local-first web application designed to rebuild this preparation process from scratch as an AI-native system. Using a Vue frontend and a Python FastAPI backend, the application leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture with a local ChromaDB vector store and the Gemini API. While ideally this system would run a fully local Large Language Model to maximize data privacy, I utilized an API to work within my personal hardware constraints. The architecture, however, is designed so a local model can be seamlessly swapped in with the right enterprise hardware. Instead of an advisor looking for data, the system processes the client files and automatically extracts and cross-references key financial context to generate a prioritized meeting agenda.

However, in the financial sector, an AI operating in a black box is a liability. To ensure operational reality, I built strict explainability into the system. Every insight generated by the AI is explicitly tied to a specific source document and page number, which the advisor can instantly verify using a split-screen document viewer. Furthermore, the application clearly defines the boundary of the AI's responsibility, ending its role at data synthesis. The critical decision that must remain human is the final strategic recommendation. While an AI can calculate that a client has unused tax-free contribution room, it cannot read a client's emotional anxiety regarding market volatility or a major life purchase. The human advisor must bring that empathy and judgment. Because of this, the system enforces a mandatory human-in-the-loop workflow. The advisor must explicitly approve or discard each AI-generated insight based on their human intuition before the finalized, vetted agenda can be exported for use.

**Logistics:**
* **Years of hands-on AI experience:** ~2 years building full-stack applications and AI systems (Python, Vue 3, Gemini, LangGraph, RAG pipelines).
* **Salary Expectation:** $90,000 - $110,000 CAD base

## Architecture

The project is structured as a monorepo containing two main parts:
- **`frontend/`**: A Vue 3 + Vite application featuring a modern split-screen interface.
- **`backend/`**: A FastAPI Python server utilizing a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with ChromaDB and Google Gemini.

## Data Flow & RAG Pipeline

1. **Ingestion**: The backend monitors a simulated internal data lake (`mock_data/{client_id}/`). Documents (PDF, TXT, CSV) placed here or uploaded via the UI are automatically parsed using `PyMuPDF`, chunked, and vectorized into a local **ChromaDB**.
2. **Generation**: When a prep brief is requested, the backend queries ChromaDB for relevant context chunks and passes them to the **Gemini 2.5 Pro** model. The model is forced to return strict, parsable JSON using the `google-genai` SDK's structured outputs (`response_schema`).
3. **Traceability**: Every AI-generated insight is strictly tied to a source document and page number, enabling full Explainable RAG.
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: The frontend displays the generated agenda. Advisors trace insights back to the source document using the integrated PDF Viewer and explicitly "Approve" or "Discard" each item.
5. **Finalization**: Only approved items can be exported and copied to the clipboard for use in a CRM or final meeting brief.

## Setup & Execution

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (3.12+)
- A [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend server:** Follow instructions in `backend/README.md`.
2. **Start the Frontend client:** Follow instructions in `frontend/README.md`.

Once both are running, open your browser to the local Vite URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to use the application.
