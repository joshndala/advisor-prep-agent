Subject: Quick update on my end - House!

Hi team,
Just wanted to give you a heads up before our annual review next week. I just got promoted at work! With the new salary bump, I'm seriously looking at buying a townhouse in Toronto within the next 18 months.

Because of this, I'm getting a little nervous about how jumpy the stock market has been lately. I don't want my down payment money to tank right before I need it. Also, I have about $15,000 sitting in my checking account right now from my year-end bonus that I haven't done anything with yet.

Let's discuss this when we meet.
Best,
Sarah
